/**
 * Step through the cluster state advancing the time to the minimum value needed
 * for it to make progress (i.e. for a message to be delivered, for an I/O
 * operation to complete or for a single time tick to occur).
 *
 * In particular, the following happens:
 *
 * 1. If there are pending #raft_io_send requests, that have been submitted
 *    using #raft_io->send() and not yet sent, the oldest one is picked and the
 *    relevant callback fired. This simulates completion of a socket write,
 *    which means that the send request has been completed. The receiver does
 *    not immediately receives the message, as the message is propagating
 *    through the network. However any memory associated with the #raft_io_send
 *    request can be released (e.g. log entries). The in-memory I/O
 *    implementation assigns a latency to each RPC message, which will get
 *    delivered to the receiver only after that amount of time elapses. If the
 *    sender and the receiver are currently disconnected, the RPC message is
 *    simply dropped. If a callback was fired, jump directly to 3. and skip 2.
 *
 * 2. All pending #raft_io_append disk writes across all servers, that have been
 *    submitted using #raft_io->append() but not yet completed, are scanned and
 *    the one with the lowest completion time is picked. All in-flight network
 *    messages waiting to be delivered are scanned and the one with the lowest
 *    delivery time is picked. All servers are scanned, and the one with the
 *    lowest tick expiration time is picked. The three times are compared and
 *    the lowest one is picked. If a #raft_io_append disk write has completed,
 *    the relevant callback will be invoked, if there's a network message to be
 *    delivered, the receiver's @raft_io_recv_cb callback gets fired, if a tick
 *    timer has expired the relevant #raft_io->tick() callback will be
 *    invoked. Only one event will be fired. If there is more than one event to
 *    fire, one of them is picked according to the following rules: events for
 *    servers with lower index are fired first, tick events take precedence over
 *    disk events, and disk events take precedence over network events.
 *
 * 3. The current cluster leader is detected (if any). When detecting the leader
 *    the Election Safety property is checked: no servers can be in leader state
 *    for the same term. The server in leader state with the highest term is
 *    considered the current cluster leader, as long as it's "stable", i.e. it
 *    has been acknowledged by all servers connected to it, and those servers
 *    form a majority (this means that no further leader change can happen,
 *    unless the network gets disrupted). If there is a stable leader and it has
 *    not changed with respect to the previous call to @raft_fixture_step(),
 *    then the Leader Append-Only property is checked, by comparing its log with
 *    a copy of it that was taken during the previous iteration.
 *
 * 4. If there is a stable leader, its current log is copied, in order to be
 *    able to check the Leader Append-Only property at the next call.
 *
 * 5. If there is a stable leader, its commit index gets copied.
 *
 * The function returns information about which particular event occurred
 * (either in step 1 or 2).
